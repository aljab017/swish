# Swish - A Simplified Command-Line Shell

## Overview

Swish is a simplified command-line shell that supports pipelined command execution. While it may not have the full functionality of standard shells like Bash, it provides a basic command-line interface for running sequences of commands in a pipeline.

This folder contains five of the main files from the Swish project. The files included here are:

1. `string_vector.h`: This header file contains the definition of a vector data structure to store strings. The string vector is used to manage strings efficiently in Swish.

2. `string_vector.c`: The implementation of the string vector data structure. This file provides the code to create, manipulate, and manage string vectors.

3. `swish_funcs.h`: The header file for Swish helper functions. This file defines the prototypes of various utility functions used throughout the Swish project.

4. `swish_funcs.c`: The implementation of Swish helper functions. This file contains the code for utility functions used by the Swish shell.

5. `swish.c`: This file is the heart of Swish, implementing the command-line interface for this simplified shell. It handles command execution, piping, and interaction with the user.
